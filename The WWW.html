<h2>The World Wide Web</h2>
<p><b>Different Definitions of the WWW:</b></p>
<div>The World Wide Web (WWW) is combination of all resources and users on the Internet that are using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
    A broader definition comes from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C):
    The World Wide Web is the universe of network-accessible information, an embodiment of human knowledge."
    The Web, as it's commonly known, is often confused with the internet. Although the two are intricately connected, they are different things. The internet is, as its name implies, a network -- a vast, global network that incorporates a multitude of lesser networks. As such, the internet consists of supporting infrastructure and other technologies. In contrast, the Web is a communications model that, through HTTP, enables the exchange of information over the internet.
    Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the Web and the director of the W3C, the organization that oversees its development. Berners-Lee developed hypertext, the method of instant cross-referencing that supports communications on the Web, making it easy to link content on one web page to content located elsewhere. The introduction of hypertext revolutionized the way people used the internet.
    In 1989, Berners-Lee began work on the first World Wide Web server at CERN. He called the server "httpd” and dubbed the first client "WWW.” Originally, WWW was just a WYSIWYG hypertext browser/editor that ran in the NeXTStep environment.
    The World Wide Web has been widely available since 1991.

    <p><b>What’s difference between The Internet and The Web ?</b></p>
Many folks consider that they both are same but are they really same?
The Internet is a global network of networks while the Web, also referred formally as World Wide Web (www) is collection of information which is accessed via the Internet. Another way to look at this difference is; the Internet is infrastructure while the Web is service on top of that infrastructure. Alternatively, the Internet can be viewed as a big book-store while the Web can be viewed as collection of books on that store. At a high level, we can even think of the Internet as hardware and the Web as software!

<p><b>Top 10 uses of the Internet</b></p>
Based on a recent survey of Internet traffic, the 10 most popular uses of the Internet in descending order of use are:
Electronic mail. At least 85% of the inhabitants of cyberspace send and receive e-mail. Some 20 million e-mail messages cross the Internet every week.
Research.
Downloading files.
Discussion groups. These include public groups, such as those on Usenet, and the private mailing lists that manages.
Interactive games. Who hasn’t tried to hunt down at least one game?
Education and self-improvement. On-line courses and workshops have found yet another outlet.
Friendship and dating. You may be surprised at the number of electronic "personals" that you can find on the World Wide Web.
Electronic newspapers and magazines. This category includes late-breaking news, weather, and sports. We’re likely to see this category leap to the top five in the next several years.
Job-hunting. Classified ads are in abundance, but most are for technical positions.
Shopping. It’s difficult to believe that this category even ranks. It appears that "cybermalls" are more for curious than serious shoppers.

Web operations (WebOps) is a domain of expertise within IT systems management that involves the deployment, operation, maintenance, tuning, and repair of web-based applications and systems. [1]
Historically, operations was seen as a late phase of the Waterfall model development process. After engineering had built a software product, and QA had verified it as correct, it would be handed to a support staff to operate the working software. Such a view assumed that software was mostly immutable in production and that usage would be mostly stable. Increasingly, "a web application involves many specialists, but it takes people in web ops to ensure that everything works together throughout an application's lifetime."[2] The role is gaining respect as a distinct specialty among developers and managers, and is considered by many to be a subset of the larger DevOps movement.
With the rise of web technologies since mid-1995, specialists have emerged that understand the complexities of running a web application. Earlier examples of IT operations teams exist, such as the Network Operations Center (NOC) and the Database Administration (DBA) function.
