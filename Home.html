    <h2><b>Topic: Digital Image Processing</b></h2>
    <strong>A. What is an Image?</strong>
    <p title="Woww"><b>Introduction and Definition:</b> An image is a 2-D signal that is processed by human visual systems.  These signals that are representing an image are commonly in the form of analog. Although for the storage, processing and the transmission through the computer applications, these signals needed to be converted from the analog form to their digital form. An image or a digital image is usually a 2-Dimensional array of the pixels. In the raw form, the images may cover a huge amount of the memory in the RAM and in the storage, both. Image compression is for reducing the redundancy and irrelevance of image/data to allow them to either store or transmit the data in a better way.</p>
    <div><b>Types of Image:</b></div>
    <p>Many type of image exist. But when talking of types of image, basically 2 types are taken into consideration which are the  <a title="Know all about Bitmap"href="file:///C:/Users/the%20fornicator/Desktop/public_html/Bitmap%20image.html" target="_blank">Bitmap</a> and <a href="file:///C:/Users/the%20fornicator/Desktop/public_html/vector%20graphic.html" target="_blank">Vector</a> Image.The form is made out of pixels, the latter is made out of lines and shapes. These two
            types of graphics are also used for different purposes and edited in different ways.</p>
    <ol><li><b>Bitmap</b></li>
    <p><b>What is a Bitmap graphic (or image)?</b></p>
    <div>Bitmap images (also known as raster images) are made up of pixels in a grid; each pixel containing a color value. These pixels (short for picture elements) are tiny, individual squares of color that are arranged in a grid to form an image. It is easy to identify a bitmap image by zooming into the image. If you enlarge the photo enough, you can clearly see the individual dot of color, as you can see on the image on the left.The term bitmap quite literally means “map of bits”. A “bit” is essentially a value of either 0 or 1. <a href="file:///C:/Users/the%20fornicator/Desktop/public_html/Bitmap%20image.html">Read more under Bitmaps... </a></div>
    <li><b>Vector image</b></li>
    <p><b>What is a Vector graphic (or image)?</b></p>
    <div>Vector graphics are computer graphics images that are defined in terms of 2D points, which are connected by lines and curves to form polygons and other shapes.[1] Each of these points has a definite position on the x- and y-axis of the work plane and determines the direction of the path; further, each path may have various properties including values for stroke color, shape, curve, thickness, and fill.[2][3] Vector graphics are commonly found today in the SVG, EPS, PDF or AI graphic file formats and are intrinsically different from the more common raster graphics file formats such as JPEG, PNG, APNG, GIF, and MPEG4 <a href="file:///C:/Users/the%20fornicator/Desktop/public_html/vector%20graphic.html"> Read more under Bitmaps...</a></ol>
        <h3>B. Image Compression</h3>
        <p>Image compression is a type of an application for data/image compression in which the basic image gets encoded with the limited bits. To lower the irrelevance and the redundancy of image data is the major target of the image compression is to enable them to get saved or transmit the data in the better form. Image compression is the lowering of the image data size, also with maintaining the required details. The basic objective of the image compression is to show an image in small quantity of bits also the needed content of information is not lost within the actual image. <a href="file:///C:/Users/the%20fornicator/Desktop/public_html/Image%20compression.html" target="_blank">Read More..</a></p>
