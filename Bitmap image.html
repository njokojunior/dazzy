        <p><b>What is a Bitmap graphic (or image)?</b></p>
        <div>Bitmap images (also known as raster images) are made up of pixels in a grid; each pixel containing a color value. These pixels (short for picture elements) are tiny, individual squares of color that are arranged in a grid to form an image. It is easy to identify a bitmap image by zooming into the image. If you enlarge the photo enough, you can clearly see the individual dot of color, as you can see on the image on the left.The term bitmap quite literally means “map of bits”. A “bit” is essentially a value of either 0 or 1.The “map” therefore refers to how these bits are arranged in a rectangular grid. In the simplest images, which contain only black and white it is possible to use just 1 bit per pixel. However, most images use more than one bit per pixel—a “true color image, for example, uses 24 bits perpixel. A very large image with many colors would therefore have a very large file size. To combat this, bitmap images can be slimmed down using lossy or lossless compression methods <br><b>Examples of Bitmap or raster image are shown below</b> <br> <div><a href="file:///C:/Users/the%20fornicator/Desktop/public_html/images/unforgetable.jpg"><img src="./images/unforgetable.jpg" width="400px" height="300px"></a>

        <p><b>How are Bitmap graphic (or image) created?</b></p>
        <div>
         When you take a photo using a digital camera or scan a drawing into your PC, you’re creating a bitmap  image. You can also create bitmap graphics using software like Microsoft Paint and Adobe Photoshop. When you edit a bitmap image, you’re editing the color values of individual pixels. This makes it difficult to edit individual elements within the image. It’s simpler to edit a bitmap image as a whole—for example, by editing its contrast or brightness, or by applying a filter (like the ones you can find on Instagram).</div>
         <p><b>Characteristics of Bitmap graphic (or image):</b></p>
         <div>Bitmap images are characterized by two parameters: the number of pixels (resolution) and the color depth per pixel.</div>
         <div>a. <b>color depth per pixel:</b> <p>it refers to the information contained within the image. For example, a 1-bit image means that a pixel could either be black or white. An 8-bit image means that each pixel can consist of any one out of 256 color values (2 to the power of 8). “True color” images use 24-bit RGB, in which there are 8 bits allocated to each red, green and blue component.8 bits each for red, green, and blue, for a total of 24 bits per pixel</p></div>
         <div>b. <b>number of pixels (resolution)</b><div>is a measure of how many pixels there are in a given area, or pixel density. This is measured in pixels per inch (PPI) or dots per inch (DPI). The resolution of an image affects the quality of the bitmap being displayed or printed. The higher the resolution, the less apparent the pixel nature of the bitmap will be. The size of the bitmap image is closely linked to the graphics display resolution—the number of pixels that an electronic visual display device or printer can display. This is because the pixels themselves have no explicit dimension. The quality with which a bitmap is printed or displayed depends on the resolution of the device. For example, the image below has the same color depth and information content. However, the smaller image is 80DPI while the larger image is 30DPI. The pixelation is more evident in the larger image</div>

                <li>Bitmaps images looks like photo and digital paintings</li>
                <li>Bitmap is a simple way to represent data</li>
                <li>The images are divided into small squares called pixels and each pixel is either black or white.</li>
                <li>The image quality depends on the high resolution and higher color depth.</li></ul></div>
