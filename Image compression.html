<h1>Image compression</h1>
<p><b>Introduction:</b></p><div>Image compression is a type of an application for data/image compression in which the basic image gets encoded with the limited bits. To lower the irrelevance and the redundancy of image data is the major target of the image compression is to enable them to get saved or transmit the data in the better form. Image compression is the lowering of the image data size, also with maintaining the required details. The basic objective of the image compression is to show an image in small quantity of bits also the needed content of information is not lost within the actual image.</div>
    <div>
        Compression techniques are developd rapidly to compress huge files of datalike images. By the rapid growth of the technology a large quantity of image data should be managed to store those images in the proper manner by the use of effective techniques normally results in the compressing images. 
Some algorithms are there which are used to perform these. types of compression in various manners like the lossless and the lossy. The image which is needs to be compressed is a gray scale having the pixel values ranges from 0 to 255.
 Compression addressed to the decreasing the number of data to be used to show content of an image, file or the video without decreasing excessively quality of actual data. Also it lowers the quantity of the bits that is needed to save and send the digital media [8].To do compression of something implies that there is a piece of data whose size is forced to decrease. For this the JPEG is a best selection for the digitized-photographs.
 The system called Joint Photographic Expert Group (JPEG) which is dependent on Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), have been a very largely used method for compression [9]. 
Image compression is one of various known techniques in the image processing. This technique may have various implementations and performs a vital role in the effective storage and transmission of the images. The image compression targeted at decreasing the redundancy in the image data to record or sends only few numbers of the samples and by this also a good accession can be reconstruct for the actual image corresponding with the perception of human visual.  
To compress images is the major target of this paper by decreasing the number of the bits on the basis of per pixel which is needed to show it and also to lower the time of transmission for the transmission of images and for reconstructing again by the Huffman encoding algorithm.

<p><b>Image:</b></p>
<div>An image is a 2-D signal that is processed by human visual systems.  These signals that are representing an image are commonly in the form of analog. Although for the storage, processing and the transmission through the computer applications, these signals needed to be converted from the analog form to their digital form. An image or a digital image is usually a 2-Dimensional array of the pixels. In the raw form, the images may cover a huge amount of the memory in the RAM and in the storage, both. Image compression is for reducing the redundancy and irrelevance of image/data to allow them to either store or transmit the data in a better way.

<p><b>Image compression:<b></p>
    <div>Decreasing the irrelevance or redundancy of an image is the fundamental aim of the image compression techniques to provide the facility for storing and transmitting the data in an effective manner. The initial step in this technique is to convert the image from the representation of their spatial domain into a separate type of the representation by the use of few already known conversions and then encodes the converted values i.e., coefficients. This technique allows the huge compression of data as compared to the predictive techniques, though at the cost of the huge computational needs. 
        Compression is obtained by eliminating any of one or more of the below three fundamental data redundancies: 
       <div> ⦁	Coding redundancy: This is presented when the less than best (that is the smallest length) code words were used.</div> 
        <div>⦁	Inter-pixel redundancy: This results from the correlations between the pixels of an image.</div> 
        <div>⦁	Psycho-visual redundancy: This is because of the data which is neglected by human visual-system (that is, visually not required information).</div> 
        Image/data Compression attains redundancy for the more effective coding:
